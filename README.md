# The MoKa Reads Specification

The MoKa Reads Specification is a set of guidelines that is expected to be followed by MoKa Reads publications and research papers
to ensure consistency and quality in the content.

This specification aims to provide a standardized framework for MoKa Reads publications and research papers, ensuring that they are well-structured, easy to understand, and consistent in their presentation. It covers various aspects such as formatting, citation styles, and content organization.

This specification as noted by our language is split into two categories:
1. Publications: Books, and other related written works.
2. Research Papers: Academic papers, research reports, and other scholarly works.
